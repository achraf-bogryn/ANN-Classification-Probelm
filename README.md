## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

In today's competitive banking industry, retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Customer churn â€” when clients close their bank accounts â€” can significantly impact a bank's profitability.

The objective of this project is to build an intelligent system that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (i.e., churn), based on their demographic and account-related information. By identifying at-risk customers, the bank can proactively implement strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates.

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to model customer behavior and predict the likelihood of churn, based on features such as age, credit score, account balance, tenure, and more.
