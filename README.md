# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

![Model Architecture](images/churn-ann.png)

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn for a bank. The model determines whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) based on personal and account-level features such as age, tenure, balance, etc.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task in the banking and telecom industries, enabling businesses to proactively retain valuable customers. In this project, we:

- Preprocessed a customer dataset (encoding, scaling, etc.)
- Built and trained an **ANN** using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluated the model's performance
- Created a **Streamlit app** to make real-time churn predictions

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Encoded and scaled customer data
- **Hidden Layers**: Two Dense layers with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: Single neuron with Sigmoid activation (binary classification)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Bank Customer Churn Dataset (CSV format)
- **Features**: Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Num of Products, Has Credit Card, Is Active Member, Estimated Salary
- **Target**: `Exited` (1 = churned, 0 = stayed)

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: ~86%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~84%
- **Loss**: ~0.35

The ANN model demonstrates reliable performance for identifying churned customers, providing banks with insight to target retention efforts.
